 # mb-ai-movement
The steering behaviours were heavily based on the work done by antonpantev here: https://github.com/antonpantev/unity-movement-ai, however since I needed to use it with the 2d physics system instead of the 3d physics system of unity, I spent some time converting just the necessary code over, and added some additional features that I wanted to use with it ( external forces and physics acting upon the entities).

 ## Usage examples
Under Assets/_mbLibs/mbAiMovement/Examples/Scenes, there are several examples that showcase the steering behaviors in scenes
In the "Moving Tiles" example, left mouse clicks toggle the direction of the tiles, while right mouse clicks create a small pulse that pushes entities away from itself.
Currently I'm developing a game that uses these 2 features here: https://marmaladebacon.com/#/projects/herding-cats
